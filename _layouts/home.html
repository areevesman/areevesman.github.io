    About me
  </h2>
    <p>
      I am a passionate data scientist who excels at machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of California, Santa Barbara and a master's degree in Data Science from the University of San Francisco.
    </p>

  <h2>
    My Background
  </h2>
  <p>
    With 6 years of experience in data science, I have delivered measurable results in both public and private sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the California <a href="https://www.dds.ca.gov/">Department of Developmental Services</a>, I create dashboards and generate detailed analytics to help provide services that allow Californians with developmental disabilities to make choices and lead independent, productive lives as members of their communities in the least restrictive setting possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to this role, I helped create and improve California state licensure examinations at the <a href="https://www.dca.ca.gov/">Department of Consumer Affairs</a> to inform, empower, and protect consumers.
  </p>
    <p>
      As a Data Engineer with <a href="https://www.saama.com/">Saama Technologies</a>, I integrated new sources of customer data into our Life Science Analytics Cloud clinical development platform and always worked to improve the efficiency and stability of our data pipelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/ua-record">Under Armour Connected Fitness</a>, I analyzed runner route popularity and designed algorithms to identify changes in user activity from GPS time series data.
    </p>
    <p>
      I previously worked with the <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/">National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis</a> where I contributed to open source R packages for managing submissions to the <a href="https://arcticdata.io/">Arctic Data Center</a>. In addition, I used R and Python to clean and aggregate data from National Science Foundation funded research projects to prepare them for publication.
    </p>

  <h2>
    My interests
  </h2>
    <p>
      When I am not doing data science, I like to get outdoors. I am passionate about traveling and learning about different parts of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy learning new skills by working on personal projects. They can be found <a href="https://areevesman.github.io/projects">here</a>.
