    About me
  </h2>
    <p>
      I am a passionate data scientist who excels at machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of California, Santa Barbara and a master's degree in Data Science from the University of San Francisco.
    </p>

  <h2>
    My Background
  </h2>
    <p>
      I am currently a Data Engineer with <a href="https://www.saama.com/">Saama Technologies</a> where I integrate new sources of customer data into our Life Science Analytics Cloud clinical development platform and always work to improve the efficiency and stability of our data pipelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before joining Saama, I was a Data Engineering Rookie with <a href="https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/ua-record">Under Armour Connected Fitness</a>. I analyzed runner route popularity and designed algorithms to identify changes in user activity from GPS time series data.
    </p>
    <p>
      I previously worked with the <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/">National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis</a> where I contributed to open source R packages for managing submissions to the <a href="https://arcticdata.io/">Arctic Data Center</a>. In addition, I used R and Python to clean and aggregate data from National Science Foundation funded research projects to prepare them for publication.
    </p>

  <h2>
    My interests
  </h2>
    <p>
      When I am not doing data science, I like to get outdoors. I am passionate about traveling and learning about different parts of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy learning new skills by working on personal projects. They can be found <a href="https://areevesman.github.io/projects">here</a>.
