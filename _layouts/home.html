    Background
  </h2>
    <p>
      As a Data Engineering Rookie at at Under Armour, I analysed runner route popularity and designed algorithms to identify changes in user activity from GPS time series data.

    <p>
      Before joining Under Armour, I worked with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, where I contributed to open source R packages for managing submissions to the Arctic Data Center. In addition, I used R and Python to clean and aggregate data from National Science Foundation funded research projects to prepare them for publication.
