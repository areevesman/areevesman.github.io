In my free time, I am learning new skills by working on projects that highlight my interests. Here are a few that I am most proud of.

## Machine learning

- [Reinforcement learning for *Snake*](https://github.com/areevesman/reinforcement-learning-for-snake)
     - Training agents to play *Snake* using techniques from reinforcement learning. Tabular Q-learning and Value Function Approximation are implemented (using a simple Neural Network) in Python.
 
- [Predicting Reddit Comment Upvotes](https://github.com/areevesman/reddit-upvote-modeling)
    - Predicting how many upvotes a comment will get, given the comment text, user history, subreddit and thread details. Uses Python and scikit-learn.
    - The associated [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-reddit-comment-karma-a8f570b544fc) highlights the workflow and provides a tutorial for those who are new to machine learning, Python, or scikit-learn.
    
- [Predicting Response Times of the San Francisco Fire Department](https://github.com/areevesman/SFFD-response-times)
    - Predicting response times of the San Francisco Fire Department Using Apache Spark and MLlib.
    
## Data visualization

    - Using Spotify Wrapped playlists to tell a story with visualizations and analysis. Created classification models to predict which user would prefer a given song as well.
    - The [github repository](https://github.com/areevesman/spotify-wrapped) contains the Python code used to create the plots with popular tools like matplotlib and plotly and to create and compare machine learning models with sklearn.
    
- [The Simpsons meets Data Visualization](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-simpsons-meets-data-visualization-ef8ef0819d13)
    - Analyzing the episode scripts to tell a story with visualizations and analysis. 
    - The [github repository](https://github.com/areevesman/the-simpsons) contains the Python code used to create the plots with popular tools like matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, and altair.
    
-  [A History of Major League Baseball's Active Franchises](https://areevesman.shinyapps.io/history/)
    - A shiny web app for comparing regular season statistics for Major League Baseball franchises.
    - The [github repository](https://github.com/areevesman/mlb_history_web_app) contains the Python code used to scrape the data and the R code used to create the application.
    
- [California Apartment Listings](https://areevesman.shinyapps.io/listings_in_california/)
    - A shiny dashboard that displays apartment listings in California.
    - The [github repository](https://github.com/areevesman/housing-shiny) contains the R code used to create the application.
