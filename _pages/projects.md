Below you will find a variety of my personal projects. 

- [Reinforcement learning for Snake](https://github.com/areevesman/reinforcement-learning-for-snake)
     - Train agents to play snake using techniques from reinforcement learning. Tabular Q-learning and Value Function Approximation are implemented (using a simple Neural Network) in Python.
